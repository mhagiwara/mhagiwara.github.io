## Work Experience

* Feb. 2015 - Present: **Software Engineer - Duolingo, Inc.** (in Pittsburgh, PA)

* Oct. 2010 - Feb. 2015: Lead Scientist - Rakuten Institute of Technology (in New York)
    - Implemented machine transliteration (NLP2011 paper award) and machine translation for e-commerce
    - Built Chinese/Japanese word segmentation, morphological analysis, named entity extraction systems
    - Lexical knowledge acquisition and information extraction from the Web
    - Developed writing support system for English as a Second Language (ESL) learners

* Apr. 2009 - Sep. 2010: **Research and Development Engineer - Baidu Japan, Inc.** (worked in Shanghai / Beijing / Tokyo)
    - Planned and acted as a lead developer in various projects including [Unnatural language processing contest](http://www.baidu.jp/unlp/) and [Baidu Mobile Corpus and Timed Corpus](http://www.baidu.jp/corpus/).
    - Worked on the ranking and page analytical algorithms including spam detection for [Baidu mobile search](http://m.baidu.jp). Also worked on the mobile emoticon search using various NLP semantic analysis techniques.
    - Worked on various NLP topics including - word / sentence analysis technologies, synonym mining and dictionary construction, proper noun detection, Japanese Input Method [BaiduType](http://ime.baidu.jp), etc.

* Apr. 2008 - Jul. 2008: **Research Intern - Microsoft Research, Redmond, USA.** (Mentor: Hisami Suzuki)
    - Proposed a state-of-the-art method for Japanese query alteration, which corrects misspellings and normalizes the spelling/transliteration variants, with higher accuracy than previous systems.
    - Implemented the system using Visual C#, SQL Server, and Ruby, with tens of gigabytes of query log. This system is being integrated into Microsoft Live Search (http://www.live.com/).
    - Developed a method to automatically and efficiently generate query re-writing pairs from session log.
    - Presented the project at the 3rd NLP Symposium for Young Researchers and was awarded the outstanding presentation award. Presented at NAACL 2009.

* Nov. 2006 - Aug. 2007: **Developer - IPA, JAPAN: Exploratory Software Project.** (Project Manager: Prof. David J. Farber)
    - Accepted as the Exploratory Software Project "Serendi: A Location-Aware Social Networking Platform," a meta social networking service targeted at mobile devices with GPS. (acceptance ratio 23.4%)
    - Developed the "compatibility" analysis module, which recommends users in real time based on natural language processing and network analysis. Used PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, MySQL, and ActiveRecord.
    - Conducted an extensive user test with more than 50 users and confirmed the reliability of the system.

* Aug. 2005 - Sep. 2005: **Intern (Software Engineer), Google Inc., CA, USA.** (Mentors: Dekang Lin and Jun Wu)
    - Participated in the two-month internship program, as one of the few interns chosen from Japan, as it was only the second year since the internship program started.
    - Improved Japanese query suggestion, which is currently used as the basis for the query suggestion shown at the top and bottom of the Google search result.
    - Fully used the parallel distributed computation algorithms such as MapReduce and the large network cluster infrastructure which Google offers.

* Apr. 2006 - Mar. 2007: **Research Assistant, Nagoya University**
    - Proposed and implemented some extension and selection methods of context for lexical similarity computation, to increase the performance of linguistic resources construction such as thesauri.
