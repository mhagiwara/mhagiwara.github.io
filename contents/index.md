# Masato Hagiwara

<p style="height: 24px;"></p>

I am a Researcher / Machine Learning Engineer currently working at [Duolingo](Duolingo). I love languages, machine learning, and everything in between.

I love learning languages. I speak Chinese, Japanese, and English fluently, and am learning Korean and [Lojban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban). I helped launch the [Japanese](https://www.duolingo.com/course/ja/en/Learn-Japanese-Online), [Korean](https://www.duolingo.com/course/ko/en/Learn-Korean-Online), and [Chinese](https://www.duolingo.com/course/zh-CN/en/Learn-Chinese-Online) courses on Duolingo. My research projects recently appeared on [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/05/3-habits-of-successful-language-learners/) and [Quartz](https://qz.com/1215361/the-best-time-of-day-to-learn-a-new-language-according-duolingo-data/).

## Projects

- **Duolingo** - I build and do research for [Duolingo](http://www.duolingo.com/), the most popular language learning app in the world, and [Duolingo English Test](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/), an affordable and accessible English certification test developed by Duolingo.

- **Rakuten MA** - [Rakuten MA](https://github.com/rakuten-nlp/rakutenma) is a morphological analyzer for Chinese and Japanese written entirely in JavaScript.

- **Books** - I co-authored the Japanese book [Natural Language Processing: Basics and Technology (Shoeisha)](http://www.shoeisha.co.jp/book/detail/9784798128528). I'm also the lead translator of two O'Reilly books: ["Natural Language Processing in Python"](http://nltk.org/book/) and ["Machine Learning for Hackers"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920018483.do).

- **Lojban** - I'm a big fan of the constructed logical language [Lojban](https://mw.lojban.org/) and built some Lojan NLP tools such as: [JavaScript Lojban Parser camxes.js](http://masatohagiwara.net/camxes.js/), [Lojban sentence search engine jufsisku](http://lojban.lilyx.net/jufsisku/), and [Lojban/English translation engine zmifanva](http://lojban.lilyx.net/zmifanva/).
